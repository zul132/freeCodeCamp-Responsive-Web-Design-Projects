# freeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Projects-for-Learning
Simple Web Design projects for learning HTML and CSS. Includes all the projects covered under freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Certfication course.

## Project 1: Cat Photo App using only HTML
The first website I built under this course is a cute and simple Cat Photo App using various HTML tags and elements including images,checkbox,radio button, web forms and much more.

## Project 2: CSS Cafe Menu
CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements. 
In this course, I learnt basic CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.
